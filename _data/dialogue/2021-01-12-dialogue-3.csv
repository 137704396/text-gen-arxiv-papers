Transforming Multi-Conditioned Generation from Meaning Representation,2021-01-12 01:45:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04257v1,Joosung Lee,"cs.CL, cs.AI",dialogue,"In task-oriented conversation systems, natural language generation systems
that generate sentences with specific information related to conversation flow
are useful. Our study focuses on language generation by considering various
information representing the meaning of utterances as multiple conditions of
generation. NLG from meaning representations, the conditions for sentence
meaning, generally goes through two steps: sentence planning and surface
realization. However, we propose a simple one-stage framework to generate
utterances directly from MR (Meaning Representation). Our model is based on
GPT2 and generates utterances with flat conditions on slot and value pairs,
which does not need to determine the structure of the sentence. We evaluate
several systems in the E2E dataset with 6 automatic metrics. Our system is a
simple method, but it demonstrates comparable performance to previous systems
in automated metrics. In addition, using only 10\% of the data set without any
other techniques, our model achieves comparable performance, and shows the
possibility of performing zero-shot generation and expanding to other datasets.",2021-01-12
Continual Learning in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,2020-12-31 08:44:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15504v1,"Andrea Madotto, Zhaojiang Lin, Zhenpeng Zhou, Seungwhan Moon, Paul Crook, Bing Liu, Zhou Yu, Eunjoon Cho, Zhiguang Wang","cs.CL, cs.AI",dialogue,"Continual learning in task-oriented dialogue systems can allow us to add new
domains and functionalities through time without incurring the high cost of a
whole system retraining. In this paper, we propose a continual learning
benchmark for task-oriented dialogue systems with 37 domains to be learned
continuously in four settings, such as intent recognition, state tracking,
natural language generation, and end-to-end. Moreover, we implement and compare
multiple existing continual learning baselines, and we propose a simple yet
effective architectural method based on residual adapters. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed architectural method and a simple replay-based
strategy perform comparably well but they both achieve inferior performance to
the multi-task learning baseline, in where all the data are shown at once,
showing that continual learning in task-oriented dialogue systems is a
challenging task. Furthermore, we reveal several trade-offs between different
continual learning methods in term of parameter usage and memory size, which
are important in the design of a task-oriented dialogue system. The proposed
benchmark is released together with several baselines to promote more research
in this direction.",2020-12-31
"Interpretable NLG for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems with Heterogeneous
  Rendering Machines",2020-12-29 07:41:48+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14645v1,"Yangming Li, Kaisheng Yao",cs.CL,dialogue,"End-to-end neural networks have achieved promising performances in natural
language generation (NLG). However, they are treated as black boxes and lack
interpretability. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework,
heterogeneous rendering machines (HRM), that interprets how neural generators
render an input dialogue act (DA) into an utterance. HRM consists of a renderer
set and a mode switcher. The renderer set contains multiple decoders that vary
in both structure and functionality. For every generation step, the mode
switcher selects an appropriate decoder from the renderer set to generate an
item (a word or a phrase). To verify the effectiveness of our method, we have
conducted extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets. In terms of automatic
metrics (e.g., BLEU), our model is competitive with the current
state-of-the-art method. The qualitative analysis shows that our model can
interpret the rendering process of neural generators well. Human evaluation
also confirms the interpretability of our proposed approach.",2020-12-29
