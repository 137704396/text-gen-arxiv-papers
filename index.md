title: ArXiv Text Generation Papers
description: Searches for types of text gen papers

These are the categories of work I'm crawling via API searches.  You can find the actual search terms on the [About]({{site.url}}pages/about.html) page.

* [Story]({{site.url}}categories/story/story.html)
* [Dialogue]({{site.url}}categories/dialogue/dialogue.html)
* [Image2Text]({{site.url}}categories/image2text/image2text.html)
* [Games]({{site.url}}categories/games/games.html)
* [Poetry]({{site.url}}categories/poetry/poetry.html)
* [Knowledge]({{site.url}}categories/knowledge/knowledge.html)

There are also some links (in progress) to articles, demos, repos, and other things that aren't ArXiv papers [here]({{site.url}}pages/non_arxiv_links.html).

Like this?  It took way too much time because Jekyll isn't good at categories and I'm not good at Jekyll. :)  [Buy me a beer or coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/svcB4UR).
