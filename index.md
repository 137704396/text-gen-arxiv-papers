# ArXiv Text Generation Paper Searches

This site is to help me keep up with text generation topics of interest to me.  These are the rough categories of work I'm crawling via API searches.  You can find the actual search terms on the [About]({{site.url}}pages/about.html) page.

* [Story / Narrative]({{site.url}}categories/story/story.html)
* [Dialogue]({{site.url}}categories/dialogue/dialogue.html)
* [Image2Text]({{site.url}}categories/image2text/image2text.html)
* [Games]({{site.url}}categories/games/games.html)
* [Poetry and Lyrics]({{site.url}}categories/poetry/poetry.html)
* [Knowledge Graphs]({{site.url}}categories/knowledge/knowledge.html)

There are also some links (in progress) to articles, demos, repos, and other things that aren't ArXiv papers [here]({{site.url}}pages/non_arxiv_links.html).

Like this?  It took way too much time because Jekyll isn't good at categories and I'm not good at Jekyll. :)  [Buy me a üç∫ beer or ‚òï coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/svcB4UR) or a [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/arnicas).
